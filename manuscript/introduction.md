# Introduction

Most probabability and statistics textbooks start out by teaching you the mathematical basis for probability theory, 
then move on to discuss probability distributions and 
eventually arive at statistical inference. 
In this book, 
the approach is to cast all statistics problems in a decision framework, 
so that you can understand how statistics should affect the decisions you make 
in your every day life. 
If you are reading this textbook to teach yourself statistics, 


I suggest you skip the rest of the introduction and 
immediately proceed to Chapter 1.
