# Decision making under certainty

This chapter is going to have a number of very silly examples. 
In each example, you will be asked to make a decision about the best course of action. 
Then we will walk through the decision that we think is the best and why. 
The examples will be silly because there will be no surprises, i.e. you will know exactly what will happen under each possible decision. 
We call this *decision making under certainty*.


## Two-headed coin

Your friend Alice is willing to make a bet with you about the outcome of a coin flip. 
Amazingly, she is even willing to let you provide the coin although she insists on flipping it. 
You will each set one dollar on the table, she will flip the coin, you will make your call in the air, and the coin will land on the floor. If the face up side is the side you called, then you take both dollars, but otherwise Alice takes both dollars.

Since Alice is allowing you to bring the coin, you decide to bring a coin that has a head on both sides.
