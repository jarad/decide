# Appendix A: Probability models

Probability distributions can be categorized by whether the support for the distribution is discrete or continuous. 
A discrete support means the random variable can only take on the values of a finite or countably infinite number of values while a continuous support means the random variable can take on uncountably infinite number of values.
This appendix introduces a number of discrete and continuous distributions that are often used in constructing a statistical model for data. 

Throughout this appendix I will be using a capital {$$}Y{/$$} to indicate the random variable, i.e. the value the data could take on, {$$}y{/$$} to indicate the realized value of the random variable, and Greek letters to indicate parameters of the distributions. 
In this appendix, we treat the parameters as if they are known and therefore I am deviating from my previous convention introduced in Chapter ??. 
But the idea here is that when building a model for real data, the parameters are unknown and we will estimated using the observed data.
